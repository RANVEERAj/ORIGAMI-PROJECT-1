           <h1>Origami Designs and Instructions</h1>
            <br>
          <p style = "font-size:25px"> Origami is the art of paper folding, which is often associated with
                 Japanese culture. In modern usage, the word "origami" is used as 
                 aninclusive term for all folding practices, regardless of their culture of 
                 origin. The goal is to transform a flat square sheet of paper into a 
                 finished sculpture through folding and sculpting techniques. Modern 
                 origami practitioners generally discourage the use of cuts, glue, or 
                 markings on the paper. Origami folders often use the Japanese word 
                 kirigami to refer to designs which use cuts.</p>
